This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked HTML error: referencing an image with an incorrect or non-existent source path. The `brokenImage.html` file contains the error, resulting in a broken image icon being displayed in the browser. The `fixedImage.html` file provides the corrected version.  This error can be difficult to troubleshoot if not carefully examined when inspecting the page's source and network requests.
